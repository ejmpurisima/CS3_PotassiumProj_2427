The webpage explores **Alice in Borderland**, a Japanese survival thriller manga series originally written and illustrated by Haro Aso, as well as its Netflix adaptation of the same name, directed by Shinsuke Sato. Alice in Borderland follows a group of people who are transported to a parallel, deserted Tokyo called the *Borderland* where they must play dangerous, life-or-death games to survive.
